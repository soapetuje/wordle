# Wordle Analysis

After losing my streak in Wordle(https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), I decided to analyze the original word list to visualize the most frequent letters in all 5 positions as well as overall.

## How to Run
* In command terminal navigate to the folder where wordle.py file is located
* Run 'python wordle.py'

## How it works
This uses Python along with the matplotlib library for the bar plots

## Implementation

The files consist of:
* ['wordle.py'](wordle/wordle.py)
* ['Wordle.txt'](wordle/Wordle.txt)

### ['wordle.py'](wordle/wordle.py)

This file contains the main code that analyzes the words and generates the visualizations

### ['Wordle.txt'](wordle/Wordle.txt)

This file contains the wordle words that were analyzed. The words were gotten by looking at the main.e17c80f8.js on the wordle website.
